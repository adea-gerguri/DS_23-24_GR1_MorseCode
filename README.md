# Morse Code encoder and decoder. Encode text with Console.Beep()

#### University of Prishtina - Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering

This is the second project from Data Security course assigned and supervised by assistant MÃ«rgim Hoti

# Language

This project is developed with Python using PyCharm Community Edition.

## Usage

This project allows users to encode and decode text to Morse code and vice-versa using three methods: text to Morse encoding, Morse to text decoding, and audio output.

- **Encoding Text to Morse Code**: This method encodes text to Morse by converting each character to its corresponding Morse representation. It takes the user's console input as a parameter.
- **Decoding Morse Code to Text**: This method decodes Morse code to text by deciphering each Morse character representation. The method uses spaces to ensure proper decoding.
- **Audio Output**: The `console_beep()` method provides audio representation alongside written Morse code as the program's output whenever the user provides plain text.
