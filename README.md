# Morse Code encoder and decoder. Encode text with Console.Beep()

#### University of Prishtina - Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering

### Supervisor

This is the second project from Data Security course assigned and supervised by PhD.C MÃ«rgim Hoti.

# Language

This project is developed with Python using PyCharm Community Edition.

## Usage

This project allows users to encode and decode text to Morse code and vice-versa using three methods: text to Morse encoding, Morse to text decoding, and audio output.

- **Encoding Text to Morse Code**: This method encodes text to Morse by converting each character to its corresponding Morse representation. It takes the user's console input as a parameter.
- **Decoding Morse Code to Text**: This method decodes Morse code to text by deciphering each Morse character representation. The method uses spaces to ensure proper decoding.
- **Audio Output**: The `console_beep()` method provides audio representation alongside written Morse code as the program's output whenever the user provides plain text.

## How to use

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your device.
2. Clone the repository or download the project files.
3. Open the project in your preferred Python IDE.
4. Run the script `morse_code.py`.
5. Follow the prompt to enter text or Morse code input and view the output.

## Expectations

This project offers a simple tool for encoding and decoding text into Morse code, with the  feature of audio output. The program provides a practical and educational experience for all who want to learn Morse Code, explore data encoding and decoding methods and experiencing with audio representation of Morse Code.
